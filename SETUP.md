# GitHub Pages Auto-Setup

Your repository is ready for GitHub Pages! The workflow is configured and will automatically deploy your site.

## Automatic Setup (Recommended)

The GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) is already configured. You just need to enable GitHub Pages once:

### Quick Enable (30 seconds):

1. Visit: https://github.com/TusharND12/gym-/settings/pages
2. Under **Source**, select **"GitHub Actions"**
3. Click **Save**

That's it! Your site will be live at: **https://tusharnd12.github.io/gym-/**

## What's Already Done ✅

- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow created
- ✅ All files pushed to repository
- ✅ `.nojekyll` file added (prevents Jekyll processing)
- ✅ Workflow configured for automatic deployment

## After Enabling

- The workflow will run automatically on every push to `main`
- Your site will be live within 1-2 minutes
- Future updates deploy automatically

## Troubleshooting

If the site doesn't appear:
1. Check the **Actions** tab in your repository
2. Ensure the workflow completed successfully
3. Wait 1-2 minutes for DNS propagation

**Note:** The workflow is already in your repository and will work once GitHub Pages is enabled in settings.
